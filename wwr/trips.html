                <h2>Ocoee River Rafting</h2>
                <img src="images/ocoee_river.jpg" alt="Ocoee River">
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>White water rafting on the Upper Ocoee River is more challenging than the Middle Ocoee section due to the big, powerful water of the 1996 Olympic course. While the beginning and ending sections of the trip are quiet enough that you can enjoy the natural beauty of the area, the river narrows through a steep set of rapids at the 1996 Olympic Kayak Slalom Course. Here you‚Äôll drop through enormous rapids like Smileys, Slam Dunk, and the double-drop of Humongous. You‚Äôll have a highly-trained guide in each raft, but boaters who take on the Upper Ocoee should be prepared to participate actively in their Ocoee white water rafting experience. A great trip for the adventurous paddler!</p>

                <p>The Section III fully guided trip offers a great day of family fun with rolling Class I, II and III rapids that increase in difficulty as the day progresses. You‚Äôll practice your rafting skills over a variety of rapids with the option to test yourself on Bull Sluice, the famous Class IV rapid, the largest rapid on Section III. Dropping 14 feet over a series of two drops, this challenging rapid provides a resounding introduction to the 2 miles of technical rapids downstream.</p>
